# CS330 Assignment 5: Disk Scheduling Algorithms Comparison
Assignment 5 - Final Project for Min Kyu Park (200378413).

# Description
This project has five different algorithms of disk scheduling: FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, C-SCAN, C-LOOK. The program will take a list that emulates a disk. The list gets loaded with values representing the position on the disk. The list will get run through each disk scheduling algorithm and return a total seek time, average seek time.
